# Readme Generator

## Description

An important piece of any repository is a profession Readme file. This file contains information relevent to users and fellow developers. During the process of building an app, a developer may fail to allocate the necessary time to creating a solid readme, and that is where this app comes into play. With one simple command, you are presented with a few questions that will help build a professional readme file automatically.

While creating this app I learned the importance of node packages, promises, and creating modular code. 

## Installation

In order to launch this app, download the repository and run the following command in the repo root:

    node index.js 

Please note you will need node/npm installed and you will need to install the necessary dependencies for the app to work.

## Usage

When you launch the app, you are presented with a few questions to help get your readme file going. Answer all of the questions and the readme file will be generated. The default name of the file is README.md and the default location is in the repo root.
